# Monster Spell Recommendation

This project builds a supervised machine learning model to recommend spells for monsters based on their traits, weaknesses, resistances, and defensive stats.

## Contents

- `Monster_Spell_Recommendation.ipynb` - Full Jupyter Notebook: EDA, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and live interactive prediction

## Problem Statement

We aim to predict effective spells for fantasy monsters by analyzing their attributes and building a multi-label classification model.

## Machine Learning Approach

- Feature engineering from JSON monster and spell data
- Custom scoring function to generate multi-labels
- Random Forest + Classifier Chain model
- Evaluation: Accuracy ~91%, low Hamming Loss
